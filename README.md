# Sensor Waveform

An Electron-based PC client for viewing sensor data, including ads1292r, max86141, m601z, etc.

The device is a customized solution based on nRF52840, nRF5 SDK. The data is transferred through USB, with proprietary protocol.

`npm run start` to start the client in debugging/development mode.

`npm run make` to build the release version. Also works on Windows. But MAC is neither tested or intentionally supported.
